      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your
        personal information when you visit our website and make purchases
        through Stripe. By accessing or using the Website, you agree to the
        collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        When you make a purchase through Stripe on the Website, we may collect
        certain personal information from you, including your name, email
        address, phone number, and shipping address. We do not collect or store
        credit card information. Stripe handles all payment processing, and we
        only receive confirmation of successful transactions.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Use of Information</h3>
      <p>
        We use the information collected from you for the following purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fulfilling orders and providing products or services</li>
        <li>Communicating with you about your order</li>
        <li>Providing customer support</li>
        <li>Analyzing sales and trends to improve our products and services</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
      <p>
        We take appropriate measures to protect the security of your personal
        information and prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
        destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or
        electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute
        security.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        We use Stripe to process payments on the Website. Please review Stripe's
        privacy policy for information on how they handle your personal
        information.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Changes to This Policy</h3>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
        in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
        We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
        this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically
        for any changes.
